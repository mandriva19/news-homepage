Mobile-first News Homepage landing. A challenge from frontendmentor.io. Built with 11ty and styled with Tailwindcss

# 11ty 
Main purpose of using 11ty instead of plain HTML is I like my projects structured well. Even if it's a small page like this one.
I like having files organized as partials and I enjoy looping through identical data from .json files. 

Eleventy is easy to use and gives you many superpowers.

# Tailwindcss
at some point I noticed myself that when there was some ideas to do a project, even a frontendmentor small project
my mind was getting uncomfortable. and this was because I knew no-one was going to pay me for what i was about to do. and having to
write all the css and jump between the files to make a design px-perfect - wasn't enjoyable thought anymore. 

I started using Tailwindcss and this feeling is gone - I  no longer have that obstacle in front of me. I actually started to enjoy
building projects even more then before!

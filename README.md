Mobile-first News Homepage landing. A challenge from frontendmentor.io. Built with 11ty and styled with Tailwindcss

# 11ty

I heard about eleventy earlier this year. But I guess I wasn't quite ready to try it out. Then on FrontEndMentor a user was using it and I explored about it lot more. and Played around with it.

I love it.

Main purpose of using 11ty instead of plain HTML is I like my projects structured well. Even if it's a small page like this one.
I like having files organized as partials and I enjoy looping through identical data from .json files.

Eleventy is easy to use and gives you many superpowers.

# Tailwindcss

at some point I noticed myself that when there was some ideas to do a project, even a frontendmentor small project
my mind was getting uncomfortable. and this was because I knew no-one was going to pay me for what i was going to do. and having to
write all the css and jump between the files to make a something px-perfect - wasn't enjoyable thought anymore.

I started using Tailwindcss and this feeling is gone - I no longer have that obstacle in front of me. I actually started to enjoy
building projects even more then before!

# Layout

Even this is fairly simple layout I still spent quite a lot of time building it. if I had 10% clue about grid before now I probably have 16 %.

and I'm still awful at styling focus states.

# deployment

I wasn't able to properly deploy this project using Netlify CLI. For some reason the GitHub token was throwing errors during the deployment with terminal.
i'm all new to this. So I created side branch for the project and manually uploaded "public" directory So I can put it in the Solution at FrontEndMentor live-url.
